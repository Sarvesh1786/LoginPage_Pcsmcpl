<h1>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</h1>


    <p>
      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15
      October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
      statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He
      was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
      aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
      science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
      Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
      intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
      missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
      Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
      launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
      organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
      nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India
      in 1974.[5] Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with
      the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
      then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
      "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
      writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of
      several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
      civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
      Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
      arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
      dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of
      Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]
