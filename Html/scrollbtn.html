    Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around $238 billion as of September 26, 2022,[4] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.[5][6]

    Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University (Ontario) and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
    
    In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly artificial intelligence (FAI). In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and he founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system and is the president of the Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education.
    
    Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting contentious perspectives regarding politics and various technologies, especially on Twitter. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla, which the SEC characterized as false and misleading. He settled with the SEC but did not admit guilt, and he temporarily stepped down from his Tesla chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who had advised the Tham Luang cave rescue. In 2022, Musk agreed to purchase Twitter for $44 billion but later submitted a termination letter of the deal, leading to lawsuits between both parties. However, Musk later rescinded the termination and moved forward with the purchase.

    Childhood and family
    Further information: Musk family
    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of South Africa,[7][8] and was baptized into the Anglican church.[9] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[10][11] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[12][13][14] His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[15][16] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, (born 1972) and a younger sister, Tosca, (born 1974).[14][17]
    
    Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[16] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[18][19][20] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father.[10] Musk later regretted his decision because he has become estranged from his father.[21] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[18][22]
    
    In his biography of Musk, Ashlee Vance described Musk as an awkward and introverted child.[23] When Musk was age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from his Commodore VIC-20[24] user manual. At age twelve, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[25][26]
    
    Education
    An ornate school building
    Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.
    Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from which he graduated.[27] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[28][29] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[30] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African Defence Force.[31]
    
    Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[32] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[33] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[34][35] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.[36][37][clarification needed]
    
    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at the Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[38] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program in materials science at Stanford University.[39] However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom instead[40] and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[28]
